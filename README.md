## Description

This is the source code for me LD46 Compo game, A Cold Walk Home. This was made in GameMaker Studio 2 and everything (including art and music) was created by me for LD46.

In this game, you must keep a creature alive as you make your way off a mountain top. You have no idea how you get there, but the creature was there when you awoke and it relies entirely on you to survive. Gather food, keep your fire going, learn to fight, and craft multiple upgrades on your way down the mountain.

You'll discover the answer to many mysteries along the way, as the story is told through a deep narrative that takes place as you play through the game. Each event triggers a new piece of the story as you try to patch together your memories about how you came to be at the top of a mountain. It's going to be A Cold Walk Home!

## Controls

Arrow Keys or WSAD to move.
Mouse to attack, interact with the user interface.

## Tips

* Keeping your fire going increases your scavenging speed, as well as reducing the amount of hunger your creature experiences while at your base.
* Watch your creature's hunger meter!
